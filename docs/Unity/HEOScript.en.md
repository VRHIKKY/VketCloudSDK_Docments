| HeliScript | Specify hs files to run. |

##ã€€Precautions
- HEOScript components must be attached to child objects under the object with the HEOField component.
- For details on writing HeliScript, refer to the pages below:
- [Class](../hs/hs_class.md)
- [Component](../hs/hs_component.md)

!!! note
    When creating a new .hs file, the file may not appear on the HeliScript list in HEOScript, due to partial file name duplications, etc.
    The issue can be solved by deleting the HEOScript component and re-attaching it to the gameobject.
