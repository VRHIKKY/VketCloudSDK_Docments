Unity's Reflection Probe is a component used to generate real-time or baked reflections in a 3D environment. This helps to improve visual realism by giving 3D objects more realistic reflections within the environment.

To use, create a default Reflection Probe GameObject in your scene (GaneObject -> Light -> Reflection Probe) and configure the settings in the Inspector.
