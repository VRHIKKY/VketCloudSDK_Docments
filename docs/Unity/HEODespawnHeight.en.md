![HEODespawnHeight](img/HEODespawnHeight.png)

HEODespawnHeight is a component that respawns the player to [HEOPlayer] (HEOPlayer.md) when the player reaches the specified threshold. <br>
This helps prevent a permanent falling state if the player falls out of the world.

You can specify the respawn threshold anywhere by manipulating the Y axis.
