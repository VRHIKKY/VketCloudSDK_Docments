# Browser window blackouts

If the browser window remains to blackout on entering the world, check the following:

|  Cause |  How to Fix |
| ----   | ---- |
| Hardware Acceleration on the browser is disabled | Enable hardware acceleration via the browser settings | 
| A gamepad is connected on the PC | Disconnect the gamepad connected to the PC |
| Build Error is unsolved | See [Build Error](./BuildError.md) for instructions |

For example, if the browser is Chrome, enabling "Use hardware acceleration when available" via the "System" section on settings may fix the blackout.
