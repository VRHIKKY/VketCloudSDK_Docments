!!! note caution
        As this action is an internal feature, it cannot be used for world creation.<br>
        For creating a gimmick for moving to another world, use [OpenWeb](Openweb.md) with the destination world URL.

JumpWorld allows you to specify a destination in another world by using a WorldID. For example, when used with a collider, entering the designated collider will enable you to warp to another world.
