![ShowHideNode](img/ShowHideNode.jpg)

Show/HideNode lets you display/hide meshes inside a .heo file.

From the Select button, you can see a list of objects to set as the target.

To set as the target, one of the following components is required in your object.

- [HEOObject](../../HEOComponents/HEOObject.md)
- [HEOField](../../HEOComponents/HEOField.md)

Depending on which you choose, the input field type will change.
For [HEOField](../../HEOComponents/HEOField.md), you can set the GameObject inside your Scene.
For [HEOObject](../../HEOComponents/HEOObject.md), you need to type the model name inside the .heo file to the field.
