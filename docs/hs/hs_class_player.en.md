## Player utility functions
### hsPlayerGet
`Player hsPlayerGet()`

Get a Player instance of yourself.

### hsPlayerGetByID
`Player hsPlayerGetByID(string PlayerID)`

Get a Player instance according to the PlayerID.

!!! caution "Change of feature for calling Player class functions"
    On SDK Ver12.x and later versions, calling Player class functions within the constructor has been disabled. <br>
    In the example below, a bool variable in the Update function is used to obtain the Player instance outside the constructor.

```
component PlayerInitSample
{   
    //Define a player object
    //Note that objects cannot be initialized here, including using functions such as hsPlayer
	Player	ex_player;

    bool    ex_isPlayerInit; //bool for handling player object initialization

    //Constructor
    public PlayerInitSample()
    {
    ex_isPlayerInit = false;
    //hsPlayerGet() cannot be called here
    }

    public void update()
    {
        //If Player instance has not been obtained yet, call hsPlayerGet() only once
        if(!ex_isPlayerInit){
        ex_player = hsPlayerGet();
        ex_isPlayerInit = true;
        }
    }
}
```
