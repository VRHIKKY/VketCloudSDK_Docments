# Setting Skybox
  
Unity's SkyBox settings cannot be directly exported with HEOExporter.
  
Instead, you may place and output a huge object (about 300m) in which the face of Box or Sphere is reversed.
For this object, please select "Unlit/Texture" for the material.

â˜… If you download the tutorial scene (Basic) from the control panel (VketCloudSDK menu > Controll Panel) , a skybox sample object will be downloaded as well.  
Copy and use it in your own projects!
