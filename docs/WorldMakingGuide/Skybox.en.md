VketCloudSDK cannot output Unity SkyBox. Therefore, instead, we need to place a Box or Sphere object whose face is reversed and output it as a pseudo skybox.
!!! note
     If you select "Unlit/Texture" for the material shader, the object will be displayed as is, without shadows.


!!!note tip
     You can obtain and use the Skybox sample by installing the tutorial scene (Basic) from the control panel (VketCloudSDK menu > Control Panel).
