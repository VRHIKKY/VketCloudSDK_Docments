# Editing Multiple HEOComponents

By selecting objects having the same HEOComponents in the Hierarchy, the component settings can be applied in a single edit.

For example, two objects having the [HEOShadow](../HEOComponents/HEOShadow.md) is in the Hierarchy as below.

By selecting the objects, the Inspector will show the HEOComponent in common, which enables editing for both objects.

If one of the objects does not have the HEOComponent in common, or no HEOComponent is in common, the notification below will be displayed.<br>
If the notification appears, re-select objects or add the HEOComponent to be edited to the object missing it via "Add Component".
