# Version 14.4.0

## HeliodorLib (Engine used in browser-displayed worlds)

### Feature Additions and Adjustments
- Omitted the functionality to display multiple general-purpose dialogs
    - This is a temporary measure due to fundamental design issues that prevented opening general-purpose dialogs in HeliScript outside of Canvas

### HeliScript
- Aligned the behavior of LayerBundle and Layer's SetShow() with hsCanvasSetLayerShow()
