# 6.1.0
- Implemented a countermeasure for instances where strange shadows were being rendered in some worlds on iOS 16.4 and later.
- Fixed an issue where if a player didn't move for an extended period, there was a delay in reflecting their movement when viewed by other players the next time they moved.
